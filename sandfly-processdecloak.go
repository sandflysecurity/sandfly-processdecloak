// Sandfly Security Linux Process Decloaking Utility
package main

/*
This utility will decloak Process IDs (PIDS) being hidden by common and not-so-common Loadable Kernel Module
stealth rootkits on Linux.

Sandfly produces an agentless Linux endpoint detection and incident response platform (EDR). Sandfly hunts for threats
against your Linux systems without loading any agents on your endpoints and works against most distributions and architectures
